Holiday Booking and Recommendation Platform
This project is a full-stack web application designed to simplify holiday planning and booking for users. It features a dynamic catalog of holiday destinations stored in a MySQL database, with details like price, trip kind, and special features.
Users can browse and refresh a curated list of available holiday destinations, register as clients to receive personalized holiday offers, book trips directly through the platform, triggering automated confirmation emails, view all registered clients and their bookings and receive tailored holiday recommendations based on their preferences and budget.

The backend is powered by Flask, connecting to a MySQL database for efficient data management. The system also integrates email functionality to send confirmations and offers, enhancing user experience.

This project demonstrates practical integration of databases, RESTful APIs, email services, and frontend/backend communication, providing a seamless travel booking experience.
